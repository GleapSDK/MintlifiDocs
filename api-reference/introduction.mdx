# Authentication

The API uses token-based authentication to secure access. To authenticate requests, you must include an API key or token in the request header.

## Authentication Headers

Include the following headers in your requests:

- `Authorization`: This header should contain the API token in the format `Bearer <token>`.

## Obtaining an API Token

To obtain an API token, follow these steps:

1. **Registration**: Sign up for an account on our platform.

2. **Authentication**: Log in to your account.

3. **Token Generation**: Generate an API token from your account settings.

4. **Usage**: Use the generated token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests.

## Example

```http
GET /api/resource
Host: api.gleap.io
Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here
```

## Project related resources

Some resources require a specific header in order to access them. The `project` header should contain the project ID.
